"""
models.py
---------
This file defines the database tables (models) for our app using SQLAlchemy ORM.

Tables:
- User: stores account info, dorm assignment, medical conditions/allergies.
- Dorm: represents a dorm building; links to its users.
- Medicine: medicines owned by users, with quantity and expiration.
- Request: anonymized medicine requests between users.

Each model includes relationships so we can easily navigate:
- User <-> Dorm
- User <-> Medicine
- User <-> Request (sent/received)
- Request <-> User (requester/provider)
