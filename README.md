## 🎓 Why Pulse?  

Getting sick in college is stressful enough—especially late at night. Pharmacies may be closed, far away, or simply impractical to reach when you’re not feeling well.

Pulse solves this problem by turning your dorm into a support system. Instead of dragging yourself across town, you can quickly and anonymously ask for medicines from students right in your building.

This makes care:

- Faster – Relief is just a few doors away.
- Easier – No more late-night pharmacy trips.
- Safer – You don’t have to leave your dorm when unwell.
- Comforting – You know your dorm community has your back.

With Pulse, a healthier, more connected campus is only one request away.
